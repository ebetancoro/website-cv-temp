# Personal Website

This is a simple personal website that showcases my CV and provides links to my professional profiles on LinkedIn and GitHub. The website is designed to be a minimalistic space where you can view and download my CV in PDF format, as well as access links to my social and professional accounts. It is temporary while I focus on creating my actual website. I am not a frontend developer so it may take a while. I am in between projects but I'll keep you updated.

## Project Structure

The website consists of the following files:

- **index.html**: The main HTML file that provides the structure of the website.
- **styles.css**: Contains the CSS to style the webpage.
- **script.js**: A simple JavaScript file (in case you want to add functionality in the future).
- **assets/**: This folder includes images and other media, such as:
  - `profile.jpg`: My profile picture.
  - `cv.pdf`: My up-to-date CV in PDF format.

## Features

- **CV Download**: The website allows users to download my CV in PDF format.
- **Links to LinkedIn & GitHub**: Direct links to my LinkedIn and GitHub profiles.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Provides the structure of the website.
- **CSS**: Handles the layout and styling of the website.
- **JavaScript**: Used for any future interactive features (currently minimal).
